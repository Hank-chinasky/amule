wxCas has been tested to compile successfully on windows (MinGW) and Linux (GCC)

On windows, the MinGW compiler was used as part as MinGW Developper Studio (v2.05).
The project file for MinGW Developper Studio is wxcas.msp, at the head of wxCas folder.

By default, wxCas is looking for a file named .aMule/amulesig.dat in your home dir,
$HOME under Linux, %HOME% under win32, i.e. /home/nick/.aMule/amulesig.dat under Linux and
C:\Documents and Settings\nick\.aMule\amulesig.dat under Windows 2000 or XP
