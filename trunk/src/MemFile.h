/**
 * CMemFile handles virtual files stored in memory.
 * 
 * This class allows for manipulation of binary data in memory such
 * as data sent over networks. Using this class rather than writing
 * the stream onto a struct confers the following advantages:
 *  - Contents may be read dynamically in case of various versions
 *    of the same packet.
 *  - Endian correction is handled transparently. When reading and
 *    writing values, CMemFile converts to and from little-endian,
 *    so that no explicit endian convertions are nescesarry.
 *  - Strings of dynamic length can be read.
 *
 * Most of these advantages also hold for writing packets.
