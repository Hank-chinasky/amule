Section 1: Protocol definition
------------------------------

Short description:

    EC protocol consist of two layers: a low-level transmission layer, and
    a high level application layer.

Transmission layer:

    The transmission layer consists of (currently) one byte data, that is
    prepended to the actual application data.

    Bit description: x01rrrrc

	x: eXtension flag, should be 0.
	r: Reserved for later use
	c: Compression flag 1 = application data is compressed.


Application layer:

    A packet contains the following:
	[ec_opcode_t] OPCODE
	[uint16] TAGCOUNT
	    <tags>

    Tags consist of:
	[ec_tagname_t] TAGNAME
	[ec_taglen_t] TAGLEN
	<[uint16] TAGCOUNT>?
	    <sub-tags>
	    <tag data>

    Tags may contain sub-tags to store the information, and a TAGCOUNT field
    is present only for these types of tags. You can test if a packet is to
    hold subpackets with HasTagCount(tagName). (Actually, a packet contains a
    TAGCOUNT field when the highest bit of its name is set.)


Notice
------

Below is a short description on prefixes used in the following sections.
    <no prefix>: tag is required to be present only once
    +: tag is requred to be present at least once, may occure more than once
	(eg. EC_TAG_STRING+ = one or more EC_TAG_STRING tags)
    ?: optional tag, may occur zero or one times.
    *: tag may occur zero or more (undefined number) times


Section 2: EC opcodes
---------------------

    EC_OP_AUTH_REQ:
	Authentication request. (client -> server)

	Tags:
	    EC_TAG_CLIENT_NAME: client name (eg. "amulecmd")
	    EC_TAG_PROTOCOL_VERSION: protocol version to use.
	    ? EC_TAG_PASSWD_HASH: password hash for authentication.
		Non-existant with empty passwords.

	Possible replies:
	    EC_OP_AUTH_FAIL
	    EC_OP_AUTH_OK


    EC_OP_AUTH_FAIL:
	Authentication failed. (server -> client)

	Tags:
	    ? EC_TAG_STRING: failure reason description


    EC_OP_AUTH_OK:
	Successful authentication. (server -> client)

	Tags: none


    EC_OP_STRINGS:
	General opcode for any text-type replies. (server -> client)

	Tags:
	    + EC_TAG_STRING: text body (lines, maybe)


    EC_OP_MISC_DATA:
	Opcode for most server replies, which consist of only a single
	piece of data.
	E.g.:
	    client: EC_OP_GET_IPLEVEL []
	    server: EC_OP_MISC_DATA [EC_TAG_IPLEVEL]

	Tags: (hard to list all)


Section 3: EC tags
------------------

    EC_TAG_STRING:
	The tag contains a UTF-8 encoded string (with trailing \0, so
	taglen = strlen(string) + 1).

    EC_TAG_PASSWD_HASH:
	ASCIIZ password hash, [32 * char], taglen := 33.

    EC_TAG_CLIENT_NAME:
	An EC_TAG_STRING dedicated to hold the client name.

    EC_TAG_PROTOCOL_VERSION:
	[uint16] protocol version, MSB = major, LSB = minor version number.
	Should be 0x0200 = v2.0.
