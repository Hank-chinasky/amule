Kry:
	Fix crypto++ issues on configure, etc
	Please add 'never show again' to the locale warning 
	The hangup on startup. Why?
	I can make a NEW VERSION check, but I need someone to have a 'newversion' file on our webspace.
	Fix the memleak I know it's there ;)
	SUGGESTION: In the search tag, it should show the amount of found items for that search (as eMule does) which is very, very useful.	
	Upload priority for Share Files isn't saved anymore, upon restart all Shared Files have 'Normal' priority.
	Fix sharedfiles prio on restart (are not saved)
        Fake Check doesn't work

[FIXED]
	
	* What to do with tags type 0? 
		It's due to some mod sending wrong tagcount. Fixed.

	* UDP Disable button remains unpushed.

	* Drop to English as default

	* Why is GetFileComment called roughtly 100x more than other functions?

	* Sources seem to be disconected after short time. Find why.  (debug version)
