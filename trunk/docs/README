                         The All-platform eD2k Client


 About
-------

  This program is a multiplatform ed2k client, fork of the eMule client, using wxWidgets class library.
  It was originally forked from xMule project but not related to it anymore, except little bits of code.


 Configuration:
----------------

  - Go to the "Preferences" tab

  - Enter a nice nickname ;)

  - Enter the "Download Capacity" and "Upload Capacity" according to your internet connection.
    All values in aMule are kiloBytes (kB), but your Internet Service Provider's numbers are
    most likely kiloBits (kb). 8 kiloBits make up 1 kiloByte, so if your Internet Connection
    is 768kb Downstream and 128kb Upstream (i.e. German Telekom DSL), your correct values are:

    Downstream: 768kb / 8 = 96kB, so you enter 96 as "Download Capacity"
    Upstream: 128kb / 8 = 16kB, so you enter 16 as "Upload Capacity"

    Anyway, these values are used to calculate the current bandwidth usage for display purposes
    only (mainly for statistics). Nevertheless, you need to know them to determine the following
    down/upload limits:

  - Enter "Download Limit" and "Upload Limit"  (IMPORTANT!)
 
    "Download Limit": leave this at 0, which stands for "unlimited". If aMule became too fast and
    you were unable to surf the Internet or whatever, change this value to something about 80%
    of your downstream capacity.
 
    "Upload Limit": set this to something around 80% of your upstream capacity.

    Setting "Upload Limit" to a value < 10 will automatically reduce your "Download Limit" (the less
    you upload, the less you are allowed to download), so upload as fast as you can.

    NOTE: 56k Modem users: aMule only accepts integral values for these settings, you can't
          enter 1.6 or whatever your sweet-spot setting is. Sorry :)

  - "Maximum Connections": As a general rule, set it to 500 - 2000.

  - "Maximum Sources per File": decide for yourself how many you want :) 300 - 500 are goo values.
    Other values are probably either too little or too much.

  - Choose the directories you want to share with other users.
    DO NOT SHARE YOUR COMPLETE HARDDISK!
    Put the stuff you want to share in a seperate Folder.
    If you share more than 200 files, you should consider that some servers have a hard limit,
    which means that you may be kicked from them if you share too many files or that some of your
    files won't be populated to the network through that server. So it is not always a good idea
    to share lots of files.

  - The other options are pretty self-explanatory. If you don't know what it does, don't touch it.

  - Don't forget to connect to a server, or you probably won't download too much ;)


 Installation
--------------

  See INSTALL file


 Basic aMule Tips
------------------

  * NEVER run aMule as root.
  * If you are behind a firewall or router, be sure that ports 4662 (TCP)
    and 4672 (UDP) are unblocked, or you will *always* get a "low ID".
  * Obtain an appropriate server.met: e.g., if you are a dialup, using
    a large server list is not appropiate.
  * Set your temp and shared directories in Preferences->Directories
    * To recursively select a certain directory, right-click over it.
  * You should *NOT* share
    * Your temp download directory!
    * Your /etc directory
    * Probably not your /var, /lib, /boot, or /usr directory
    * Certainly make sure that any really confidential files (password files, 
      private SSH keys, credit card numbers :) are *not* shared. So generally
      do not share your entire home directory, although you might want to share
      some files or directories in it.
  * Remember that you get certain download priveledges with those clients (aMule,
    eMule, etc users) to whom you upload files, in the form of reduced queue waits.
  * Please note that compilation with optimizations is not supported. If you do
    use optimization flags, don't come back crying that it is unstable. With
    optimization, unpredictable bugs could accour.


 Obtaining your first server list
----------------------------------

  Use one of the following links in the "Update server.met from URL" box in 
  the Server tab. They are apparently updated every 20 minutes.

  * The current top 50 servers (these fill up fast):
	http://ocbmaurice.dyndns.org/pl/slist.pl/server.met?download
  * The current top 150 servers:
	http://ocbmaurice.dyndns.org/pl/slist.pl/server.met?download/server-good.met 
  * The biggest list (about 300 servers) maintained by the site. Only if you have
    a very decent connection:
	http://ocbmaurice.dyndns.org/pl/slist.pl/server.met?download/server-max.met 
  * Should maurice be down for some reasons, use this server.met instead:
        http://www.srv1000.com/azz/server.met

 FAQ:
------

  -- How do I know whether my ID is high or low? --

  Look at the arrows at the bottom right corner, wrapping a world icon, next to the server
  name you are connected to. If they're green, your ID is high. If they're yellow, your ID is low.

  -- What does high and low ID mean anyway? --

  When your ID is high (green arrows), everything is fine :)
  When it's low (yellow arrows), you are probably behind a firewall or a router, and other clients can't
  connect to you directly (which is a bad thing). Please read the FAQ or search our wiki or forums on 
  how to configure your firewall/router for aMule.

  NOTE: you can also get a low ID when the server you connected to is too busy to answer
  properly, or simply badly configured. When you are sure your settings are ok and you SHOULD
  have a high ID, connect to antoher server.

  -- I'd like to search for specific file types, what filter stands for which files? --

  File Type	Extensions found
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  Audio	        .mp3 .mp2 .mpc .wav .ogg .aac .mp4 .ape .au .wma
  Video	        .avi .mpg .mpeg .ram .rm .vob .divx .mov .ogg .vivo
  Program       .exe .com
  Archive       .zip .rar .ace .tar.gz .tar.bz2 .Z .arj
  CDImage       .bin .cue .iso .nrg .ccd .sub .img
  Picture       .jpg .jpeg .bmp .gif .tif .png

  -- What are all those fancy colors in the download progress bar about? --

  Each download in the the transfers window has a coloured bar to show current
  file availability and progress.

  * Black shows the parts of the file you already have
  * Red indicates a part missing in all known sources
  * Different shades of blue represent the availability of this part in the
    sources. The darker the blue is the higher the availability
  * Yellow denotes a part being downloaded
  * The green bar on top shows the total download progress of this file

  If you expand the download you see its sources with the corresponding
  bar. Here the colours have a slightly different meaning:

  * Black shows parts you are still missing
  * Silver stands for parts this source is also missing
  * Green indicates parts you already have
  * Yellow denotes a part being uploaded to you

  Learning how the progress bar works will greatly help your understanding
  of the eD2k network.
