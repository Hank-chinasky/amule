                 The Multiplatform ed2k network client for linux
              


 About
-------

This program is a multiplatform ed2k client fork of eMule client using wxWindows class library.
It was originally forked from xMule project but not related to it anymore, except little bits of code.


CONFIGURATION:
--------------

- Go to the "Preferences" tab

- Enter a nice nickname ;)

- Enter the "Download Capacity" and "Upload Capacity" according to your internet connection.
  All values in aMule are kiloBytes (KB), your Internet Service Provider's (ISP) numbers
  are most likely kiloBits (kB). 8 kiloBits make up 1 kiloByte, so when your Internet Connection
  is 768kB Downstrean and 128kB Upstrean (like German Telekom DSL), your correct values are:

 Downstrean: 768kB / 8 = 96KB, you enter 96 as "Download Capacity"
 Upstream: 128kB / 8 = 16 KB, you enter 16 as "Upload Capacity"

 These values are used to calculate the current bandwidth usage for display purposes only!
 Nevertheless, you need to know them to determine the following down/upload limits:


- Enter "Download Limit" and "Upload Limit"  (IMPORTANT!)
 
 Download Limit: leave this at 0 (should aMule become too fast and you are unable to surf
   the Internet or whatever, reduce it to 80-90% of "Download Capacity")
 
 Upload Limit: set this to ~80% of your "Upload Capacity" (so when your Upload Capacity is 16,
   set Upload Limit to 13)

   Setting Upload Limit to a value < 10 will automatically reduce your Download Limit, so
   upload as fast as you can.


NOTE: 56k Modem users: aMule only accepts integral values for these settings at the moment, you
      can't enter 1.6 or whatever your sweet-spot setting is, yet. Sorry :) Maybe later..



- "Maximum Connections": As a general rule, set it to 500 - 2000 (hey! I
   want to see that anyone out there has 2000 concurrent connections!)

- "Maximum Sources per File": decide for yourself, how many you want :) (but
   300 is a good value, don't do too much, 500 should be pretty enough)

- Choose the directories you want to share with other users.
  DO NOT SHARE YOUR COMPLETE HARDDISK!
  Put the stuff you want to share in a seperate Folder.
  If you share more than ~200 files, you should reconsider that some servers
  have a hard limit, what means that you may be kicked from that servers if
  you share too many files or that some of your files won't be populated to
  the network on that server. Consider not to share that many files.
  
-The other options are pretty self-explaining. If you dunno what it does, don't touch it.

-Don't forget to connect to a server, or you won't probably download too much ;)


 Installation
--------------

See INSTALL file


 Basic aMule Tips
------------------

* ALWAYS run aMule as a REGULAR USER
* NEVER run aMule as root (unless you have a repressive ISP and need to use
  ports lower than 1024).
* If you are behind a firewall or router, be sure that ports 4662 (TCP)
  and 4672 (UDP) are unblocked, or you will *always* receive a low ID.
* Obtain an appropriate server.met:  e.g., if you are a dialup, using
  the max server list is not recommend.
* Set your temp and shared directories in Preferences->Directories
   *  To recursively select a certain directory, click on its box while holding
      down the CTRL button.
*  You should *NOT* share
   *  Your temp download directory!
   *  You /etc directory
   *  Probably not your /var, /lib, /boot, or /usr directory
   *  Certainly make sure that any really confidential files (password files, 
      private SSH keys, credit card numbers :) are *not* shared.  So generally
      do not share ~, although ~/files or the equivalent should be OK.
*  Remember that you get certain download priveledges with those aMule and 
   eMule users to whom you upload files, in the form of reduced queue waits.
* Please note that compilation with optimizations is not supported. If you do
  use optimization flags, don't come back crying that it is unstable. With
  optimization, unpredictable and strange bugs will probably accour.

 Obtaining your first server list
----------------------------------

1) Use one of the following links in the "Update server.met from URL" box in 
   the Server tab.  They are apparently updated every 20 minutes.

   *  The current top 50 servers (these fill up fast)
	http://ocbmaurice.dyndns.org/pl/slist.pl/server.met?download
   *  The current top 150 servers
	http://ocbmaurice.dyndns.org/pl/slist.pl/server.met?download/server-good.met 
   *  The biggest list (~300 servers) maintained by the site.  Only if you have
      a very decent connection, AFAIK.

FAQ:
----

--"How do I know whether my ID is high or low?"

 Look at the arrow in the bottom right corner, next to the server name you are connected to.
 When it's green, your ID is high. When it's orange, your ID is low.
 


-- "What does high and low ID mean anyway?"

 When your ID is high (green arrow), everything is fine :)
 When it's low (orange arrow), you are behind a firewall or router, and other clients can't
 connect to you directly (which is a bad thing). Plz read the FAQ or search the forums on 
 how to configure your firewall/router for aMule.

NOTE: you can also get a low ID when the server you connected to is too busy to answer
 properly, or simply badly configured. When you are sure your settings are ok and you SHOULD
 have a high ID, connect to antoher server.



-- "I'd like to search for specific file types, what filter stands for which files?"

 Want to help?
---------------
aMule is a free software project and requires the cooperation of it's users to help improve 
the quality of the software.  We welcome all contributions to the project in the form of new 
features, bug fixes and feature requests.

If you are not a programmer you can still contribute by providing good bug reports when you 
come accross a problem with the aMule software.  A good bug report gives the project team 
enough information to reproduce the bug (so we can see it in action) and fix it.  If possible, 
try to isolate the conditions under which the bug occurs (eg. does it happen on some specific 
window, with some specific files, some specific conditions etc.) and provide as much detail as 
you can in your report.

If you are a programmer and can fix the bug you observe, please send us a patch or a note 
about how you fixed the problem.
