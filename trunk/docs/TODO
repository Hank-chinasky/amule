Code Reorganization. BEFORE 2.0 FINAL!!!

I think that we should clean the amule cvs and sources management.
Considering that core and gui is pretty splitted i propose to:
a) move "project" directory into "src/gui" and use it to contain it!
b) move all GUI staff in gui directory
c) add "core" directory to "src"
d) add "EC" directory and move webserver and amulecmd apps there
e) add a "libs_patch" directory to manage all possibile/probably/future patch
to wx and similar libs

of course all the file modification/moving should be managed in Makefile stuff.

- Team
	- Configure Stuff:
	    + Add gtk-prefix and prefix for every lib used
	    + GUI, CMD; WEB and so on meta-packages
            + Remove optimize switch, clean for lots options no more used (gtk above all)
            + Some nice configure report [working]
            + Sources Reorganization as written above

        - Systray
            + Finish new wx tray and delete all systray options from configure [working]
	
	- Remote
            + Add remote gui [working]
            + Finish cmd line clients [working]

	- Add an option "Send a mail when transfert complete", 
		or better, execute a program (specify the parameters amule passes)

	- File Tab
	   + Add search ed2k link in clipboard (auto adding???)
	   + Add an additional option "same category" to "start next paused file..."
	   + Fix checkbox problem in notify: "a new message arrive" enabled only if "chat session" is enabled too

	- Add Scheduler Tab
	  + Add actions menu
	  + Add time and details menu
	
NEW FEATURES 
	- Keep porting eMule features (medium-high priority) [working]
	- Implement Kademlia support (preferences too) (medium priority) [working]

- Many other ideas but it seems we have a big work already ... :-)
