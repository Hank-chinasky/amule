Version 2.0.0rc7 - The "99,6% Final" version.
----------
2004-10-19

	bisley:
		* Added session ratio and total ratio to XAS

	deltaHF:
	        * Got back from hell and changed one icon on the GUI ;)

	Jacobo221:
		aMule GUI:
		* Fixed two almost-the-same bugs when clicked download button and no items where selected (as reported by powtrix/willy, thanks)

		aMuleWeb:
		* Fixed a bug where up/down limits woudln't be displayed correctly if their string length were different

		aMuleCMD:
		* Added 'list' (or 'find') command to search for a file in the downloads queue by name or by number (or just show all)
		* Added the ability to resume/pause all downloads at the same time through amulecmd (very handy when all downloads have been paused due   to lack of space)
		* Fixed two bugs on amulecmd by which using 'pause' or 'resume' without arguments would pause/resume the oldest download.
		* Fixed a bug so that help command no longer is send to core
		* Fixed other commands sending blank data to core
		* Cleaned unneeded output log messages + added sent command messages to log (for easier security monitoring)
		* Several command simplifications on amulecmd to make it easier to use (while maintaining backwards compatibility).
		* Lots of translations lacks

	KingFish:
		* Fixed broken compilation in SysTray.cpp with gcc 3.3.4.

	Kry:
		* Fixed: 	Crashes related to animation deletion on http download dialog
		* Fixed: 	0-size server.met file crashing aMule on startup and on download.
		* Fixed:	GUI blocking on server connection.
		* Fixed: 	The last (hopefully) "fixed minsize" bug. FileDetail dialog was growing :)
		* Misc code cleaning.
		* Mac: 
			* Enabling wxCocoa compilation
			* Fixed: 	Secure Ident was not working on big endian archs.
			* Fixed: 	ClientID endianess issues leading to faking low/high id
			* Fixed: 	Several fields were not having correct size on preferences.
			* Fixed: 	Curl preform_multi was crashing the http download dialog on Mac.
					This means server.met update and ipfilter update was crashing.
					Currently the fix disables 'Cancel' button on that dialog, while we
					wait for curl lib to fix this issue.
		
	lfroen:
	        * Removed debug printf's in timer.cpp
		* Fix for deadlock on connection timeout in ServerSocket.cpp
		* Fixed assert when build with wx-cvs
		* Added option for disabling SIGSEG handling: useful for debuging in amuled.cpp
		* EMSocket.h cleanup
		* Fixed unclosed sockets (CLOSE_WAIT) and few stability problems
		* Make CEMSocket::OnReceive thread safe. MAX_SIZE reduced, cause even theoretically tcp can buffer up to 64K
		* amuled fixes

	mfs:
		* Fixed crashes on friendlist when keeping keys pressed
		* Fixed one server not being removed when several servers selected
		* Fixed access problems on deleting the ipfilter while accessing it

	Phoenix:
		* Fixed '&' char next to Preferences in amuleweb web page, as
		  reported by DreamWalker.
		* ExternalConn: protected GETCATTITLE command from buffer
		  overflow.
		* Start removing unused code from ExternalConn.cpp.
		* Fixed high CPU usage problem in amuleweb, thanks to jaguarwan for
		  the report. Daemonizing amuleweb should be done using the -q
		  switch.

	ThePolish:
		* Implemented new hits system in wxCas to display and save download rate records.
		* Changed wxCas layout to try to avoid display bug with wx-cvs
		* Added translations update (Thanks to all translators)
		* Removed wxCas documentation to slim source tree (now downloadable from berlios)

	Seagull:
		* Patch adding "Directory" column to the shared-files dialog.
		* Patch to add "Swap to this file" option for sources marked as 
		  "Asked For Another File" on download queue.

	Unleashed:
		* Better fix for amuleweb's high CPU usage problem. Now main thread only gets
		  woken up when absolutely needed.

	Xaignar:
		* Reinsured that the preferences will be saved upon clicking "Ok".
		* Removed SSE2 specific optimizations from the embedded Crypto++ sources,
		  they would break very easily and crash aMule.
		* Fixed a bug where we would sometimes attempt to remove a client 
		  from the wrong file, resulting in dangling pointers and crashes.
		* Ensured that the statistics-dialog would be updated when preferences
		  relating to it where changed.
		* Added sainity checks to category-loading, to avoid adding categories
		  without incomming dir or name.
		* Initial fix for crashes if aMule tried to share an inaccessible folder.
		* The redraw problems on restoring from minimized state should be fixed.
		* Fixed the shared-files list, which would draw columns regardless 
		  of whenever or not they were hidden.
		* Fixed the progress-bars in the shared-files dialog. It should now
		  work properly for both part and completed files.
		* Fixed a bug in the ipfilter, where non-numeric chars on lines would
		  cause wrong ranges of IPs to be filtered.
		* Re-added the priority menu for servers, which had gone missing due
		  to a mistake.
		* Stopped the client-credits class from attempting to load older 
		  versions of the lists, which again would lead to mem-corruption.
		* Fixed hidden columns on download queue, which would still be drawn.
		* Added sainity checks to loading of clients.met file, since corrupted 
		  files would lead to potentially huge ammounts of mem-corruption.
		* Added "Completed Sources" column to the shared-files dialog.
		* Fixed a bug in sockets where disconnected sockets wouldn't be removed
		  immediatly, but left to timeout instead.
		* Fixed an end-less loop on the AICH thread if a file on the queue
		  was removed from the list of shared files.
		* Fixed an end-less loop when changing file-status by category.
		* Fixed the auto-priority menu-item on the download list when multiple items
		  where selected. It would un-set auto-priotity instead.
		* A bit of optimization in CPartFile. More work will follow later.
		* Properly initialized a number of variables.
		* Fixed the column-width saving/loading which I managed to break shortly before 
		  rc6 was release. Whoops. :p
		* Ampersands will no longer be doubled when lines are added to the log-view.

Version 2.0.0rc6 - The "We're so EVIL that we make you lose a sock in every pair" version.
----------
2004-10-03
	
	deltaHF:
		* GUI for MyInfo at Server window.
		* Added 'About' button.
		* Fixed sorting upload list by speed
		* Changed the Search dialog. 
		* Fixes websearch for jugle.net
		* Added hability for send msg to clients in upload queue, without having to add 
		  them as friends (based on Kry's download queue send-on-right-click implementation)
		* Translations update.

	falso:
		* New upstream cas version. Now supports creating html pages with the statistics
		* Now cas runs on netbsd.
		* Misc fixes on cas.

	GonoszTopi:
		* Patch to fix buffer overflow in cas when line had more than
		  80 chars.
		* Patch to fix help switch in ExternalConnector.cpp
		* Patch to create -c switch in amulecmd: now the command line
		  version can connect, execute a command and exit.

	Hetfield:
		* Lots of 3.4.x compilation fixes, due to -DWX_PRECOMP
		  and wx headers checks.
		* Configure cleanup, safetray remove and nice cosmetics for tools
		* Configure option added: --enable-embedded_crypto to use amule crypto code
		and bypass crypto libs. Also fix freeze problem.
		* fixed crypto usage in core with configure and compilation flags
		* Re-enable Pentium4 and SSE2 optimizations fro Crypto stuff

	Jacobo221:
		* Fixed issue on the About button.

	Kry:
		* Got back from hell.
		* Imported eMule's 0.44x new corruption handling: AICH
		   AICH stands for Advanced Inteligent Corruption Handling, and avoid having to 
		   re-download a full part everytime we get corruption on a file. With AICH, you will
		   just re-download the 184Kb block that has corruption. It uses HashTrees to achieve 
		   the corruption diagnosis. 
		   More info: http://www.emule-project.net/home/perl/help.cgi?l=1&rm=show_topic&topic_id=589
		   *********************************************************************************
		   WARNING: AICH thread will re-hash all your files on your first rc6 startup. This can 
		   take very long when the user has lots of shared files. We're sorry but that's the only 
		   way to build the HashTree and thus making AICH able to work.
		   *********************************************************************************
		* Fixed the AICH implementation to support big endian archs (like ppc).
		* Implemented IPfilter auto-load on startup
		* Implemented IPFilter 'Update Now' button on preferences.
		* Revamped the HTTP download dialog, used to download IPfilter and server.met 
		   (and probably other files in a near future) Now it's the thread who runs the dialog,
		   and dialog no longer block aMule while loading. It also has a progress bar. Yay!
		* Fixed amule daemon not allowing auto-dowload of server.met.
		* First rework of the Search dialog, later re-worked by Xaignar using the 
		  hide/show engine I did.
		* Implemented "Send messages" via right-click on source.
		* When aMule is running and you try to run a second aMule, it now send a 
		   'raise' message to the current runing one. This is designed to fix the problems
		   with aMule being in a inexistant systray and thus people being unable to recover it.
		* Fixed documentation:
			* Bugs on  kb/kB mistakes
			* Added "What are all those fancy colors in the download progress bar about?"
		* --version switch now returns 0 (sucessfull app termination)
		* MOD_VERSION_LONG does no longer show 2.0.0 version on CVS
		* Cleaned the GUI for LOTS of unnecessary wxSizers that were looking ugly on Mac
		   and making wxDesigner project file much cleaner.
		* Fixed memleaks on curl usage (thanks Seagull)
		* Systray is now skinnable
		* Safety checks: A File can't have more than 441 partcount
		* Added a file-access tracker that allowed us to fix lot of file access bugs:
			* We were closing invalid file descriptors!
			* Random Error responese from CFile class, again
			* Misc multiple bugs that made me kinnda rewrite the class
		* Fixed user not being notified of duplicated files on shareds
		* Safe load for clients.met (no more removing to load amule)
		* Fixed PrefsUnifiedDlg using wrong events for Spin controls.
		* Search textbox now accepts enter key (did it work before? or never worked?)
		* aMule now compiles and works with wxWidgets 2.5.2, with no gui bugs
		* Fixed a nasty cvs bug that was just taking '0' on upload settings as 0, not unlimited.
		* Fixed CArray implementation to avoid ints and make usage of size_t and off_t
		* Added GetConnectIP() implementation to BaseClient so we can hold the supposed IP 
		   or (after we had a connection) the real IP
		* Implemented extra-file_corruption_safety on files. No more 'please rm -rf .aMule/'
		* Implemented safe recover of .part.met files.
		   This means that if a .part.met file gets corrupted, aMule will take care of it and try 
		   to recover it with minimal info. As a matter of fact, only filesize and hash is need,
		   so any other info will be recovered or set to default instead of discarding the part file.
		* Fixed mem corruption on BaseClient
		* Fixed a crash on UploadListCtrl due to access to a either uninitialised or removed client.
		* Fixed the annoying empty message being sent every time a client connects to us while 
		  we have a chatwindow with him. this was really pissing people off ;)
		* Reworked SafeFile.cpp and made it compatible with eMule 0.44x. 
		* aMule defaults to maximize if not size not overriden and no gui size stored (robably first run)
		* Implemented CDirIterator. 
		   Used to get rid of wxFindFirstFile and such buggy functions (breaking filenames on Mac and others). 
		* Added GUI preferences fo AICH's hash trusting and IPfilter new options.
		* Corrected xMule version show. xMule started sending correct version tags on 1.9.1b, only 4
		   months after I told them, and only 1 after eMule+ developers did. Is based on our implementation
		   (x.y.z instead of eMule's x.ya), so it was not hard to show them correctly ;)
		* Misc developing, memleak fixing, code rewrite, and co-workers abuse by insulting 
		   them and degrading them to worm state.
		
		* Kademlia Import:
			kademlia/utils
			* UInt128.cpp (class for handling 128-bits integers, added hability to read/write on SafeFile).
			* UInt128.h
			* All other files on the kademlia/utils are not needed by aMule.
			kademlia/kademlia/
			* Defines.h
			* Entries.h
			* Error.h
			* Tag.h
			kademlia/routing/
			* Map.h

		* Mac:
			* Fixed compilation near every day :)
			* Fixed the file descriptor problems, using the new file access tracker.
			* Fixed the clients.met file being saved badly and thus breaking load.
			* Fixed Search page not setting the SearchType to default.
			* Fixed the start, clear and clear all buttons on Search page
			* Fixed wrong usage (at least on Mac) of multi line control functions on single line text control
			* Fixed sharing dirs giving access errors (and probably on other archs than Mac).
			* Fixed amule daemon for taking 100% (or 198% on a dual system) CPU.
			* Fixed wrong filenames being shown when more than 24 chars. See CDirIterator above.
			* Fixed 'MyInfo' tab showing wrong endianess on IP.
			
		* Deleted files:
			eMule-Import-Status	-> Very old unused file.
			RC1-KnownBugs	-> Very old unused file.
			HTTPDownloadDlg.*	-> HTTPDownload.* (no longer a GUI file)
			

	lfroen:
		* Core/GUI separation:
			* Moved all GUI code out of Core files.
			* Made a new socket engine to be able to use wxSocket on wxBase, even when
			   wxBase has no event pool.
			* aMule daemon is now functional,  but it still need hard testing.
			   Enable it using --enable-amule-daemon.
			   You can control it via any EC app (amulecmd, amuleweb)
			* aMule separated GUI does not compile right now, and the communication
			   with the core will be improved as EC is rewritten by GonoszTopi.
		* Fixed crash on DownloadClient
		* Misc aMule fixes here and there :)
			
	Littletux:
		* Patch to include UTF-8 support in systray.
		* Patch to fix configure.in UTF-8 SysTray code.

	Phoenix:
		* Fixed a compilation warning + appartently useless code in 
		  DirectoryTree.cpp.
		* Fixed amuleIPV4Address for wx-2.5.2 and up.
		* Fixed the low number of sources problem with wx-2.5.2 and
		  up. Problem was in CUDPSocket::SendBuffer, now there is a
		  macro to test. aMule should be 2.5.2 network ready now.
		* wxCHECK_VERSION(2,5,0) no longer necessary in
		  amule{web,cmd} for wxApp because we have now -DwxUSE_GUI=0.
		* New command line parameter in amulecmd: -pw or --password.
		* New commands in amulecmd: serverconnect, reloadipf and
		  setipfilter. Thanks rommel for the initial patch.
		* Fixed amulecmd command parser. Help was not coherent and
		  giving syntar errors.
		* Rewrote command parser/processor im amulecmd to use
		  wxStrings.
		* Some i18n stuff in amulecmd.
		* Rewrote amulecmd and amuleweb, creating a new module,
		  ExternalConnector.cpp. This module has a lot of code
		  common to both programs, and will make it easier to
		  maintain.
		* Fixed a small wxString bug in CamuleDlg::AddLogLine() 
		  in amuleDlg.cpp.
		* Improoved wxSting usage in ExternalConn.cpp.
		* Yielding in DownloadQueue.cpp Init() so that gui is not 
		  blank when loading lots of files.
		* A little better font/color handling in amulewebDLG and 
		  amulecmdDLG.
		* New command line parameter for amuleweb, amulewebDLG,
		  amulecmd and amulecmdDLG: -f. This parameter reads the
		  ECPpassword and the ECPort from the [ExternalConnect]
		  section of file ~/.eMule. This way, the plain text password
		  doesn't have to be passed in the command line.
		* Updated socket-2.5.c to the latest wx-cvs code. 
		  Fast reconnect -> lowid bug is fixed in wx-cvs now. When
		  wx-2.5.3 is out, we will finally be able to drop this file.
		  It will only be needed for versions 2.5.0(?) to 2.5.2.
		* Removed gsocket-2.5.h from the project. This file was not
		  beeing used anymore.
		* Added command line parameter "-q" or "--quiet" to
		  amuleweb(Dlg) and amulecmd(Dlg). This is to run amuleweb
		  without any output to stdout, so that it does not need a
		  terminal.
		* Changed amulewebDLG and amulecmdDLG to use sizers.
		* Removed a bug in WebSocket.cpp: was not testing the return
		  value of Accept, this could create a thread with a NULL socket.
		* Added two new commands to amulecmd(DLG), GetIPLevel and
		  SetIPLevel <new level>.
		* Rewrote most of the wxString usage of amule web server in
		  ExternalConn.cpp. There should be some speed improovement.
		* Removed pop up when web server requested ed2k source link
		  and amule was low id.
		* Fixed a problem with Server Connect command in amulecmd, it
		  was not working. It has been renamed to ConnectTo. Also
		  fixed help command output, should look better now.
		* Added "-fmessage-length=0 -W" flags when --enable-debug.
		* Changed m4/wxwin.m4 to recognize wx-config --libs base (no
		  equal sign from 2.5.3 and up).
		* Unicode fix in SysTray and new compiler wanings fix due to
		  new compiler debug option -W.
		* Some more consts in code due to CDownloadQueue::GetFileByIndex()
		  and CSharedFileList::GetFileByIndex(). Also cleaned those
		  functions.
		* Fixed Resume/Pause bug in amulecmd/amule. Now Resume/Pause
		  argument starts at zero.
		* More gsocket.h update.
		* Debug protocol options. Comment/Uncomment:
		    #define DEBUG_LOCAL_CLIENT_PROTOCOL in BaseClient.cpp
		    #define DEBUG_REMOTE_CLIENT_PROTOCOL in ListenSocket.cpp
		    #define DEBUG_SERVER_PROTOCOL in ServerSocket.cpp
		    #define DEBUG_CLIENT_PROTOCOL in sockets.cpp
		* Changed configure.in to no longer use gsocket-2.5.c for 
		  wx-2.5.3 and up.
		* Fixed the Random Lowid Bug.
		* Cleaner solution to RLB: Accept() the connection and
		  Destroy() the socket immediately.
		* Fixed a lot of bugs in amuleweb. In particular, stop / pause
		  / cancel / priority(up/down) now works.
		* Removed bubble sort code in download queue from amuleweb.
		  This code did not scale for large number of files, like
		  hundreds. There is still room for improovement here.
		* Fixed a bug in SafeFile.cpp. wxString.Length() returns the
		  number of codes in the string, which is less than or equal
		  to the number of bytes in a multibyte encoded string. This way, 
		  amule will also not crash with locale search strings like korean,
		  japanese and chinese.
		* Several amuleweb/ExternalConn bug fixes. Now the
		  communication is in UTF8, so that soon amuleweb non-unicode can 
		  communicate with amule unicode and vice-versa. There was a
		  bug when the number of files was more than approximately 90
		  because the communication routines could not handle strings
		  greater than 64K chars. There is still some replicated code
		  in ExternalConn.cpp, but the idea is that it will use the
		  code in ECSocket.cpp.
		* Bug fix in ExternalConn.cpp. ECSocket must have the
		  wxSOCKET_WAITALL flag to work properly when the message has
		  more than 64Kbytes. aMule now uses ECSocket.cpp, no more
		  replicated code in ExternalConn.cpp.
		* Fixed a bug in ListenSocket.cpp, m_client can be null after
		  ProcessSecIdentStatePacket(), so, we must check.
		* Fixed conversion problems in ECSocket.cpp. Now external
		  connections in UTF-8 are really working, and
		  amuleweb/amulecmd (unicoded or not) can connect to amule
		  (unicoded or not).
		* Fixed an unprotected call to strlen() in ECSockets.cpp, if 
		  you pass a NULL pointer to it, the program segfaults.
		* Added a timer for idle repainting in amulewebDLG and
		  amulecmdDLG.
		* Fixed this assertion in Preferences.cpp: [Debug] 07:02:00 AM: 
		  include/wx/longlong.h(155): assert "(m_ll >= LONG_MIN) && 
		  (m_ll <= LONG_MAX)" failed: wxLongLong to long conversion
		  loss of precision.
		* Reimplemented "Show Rates On Title" preference.
		* Initial import of new MD4 hash code from emule 0.44a into
		  KnownFile.{cpp,h}.
		* Removed amuleweb html template 12 char password limitation.
		* Small fixes to UTF-8 SysTray support patch.
		* Several unicode fixes.
		* New macro in otherfunctions.h: unicode2charbuf(x) -- used
		  when you need to store a (char *) to use several times.

	Rommel:
		* Patch to implement the commands serverconnect and reloadipf
		  in amulecmd.

	ThePolish:
		* i18n amule log lines (server window)
		* amulecmd and webinterface i18n fixes
		* Some win32 fixes (slashes and backslashes)
		* Automake 1.8 fixes
		* Add traditionnal Chinese translation (zh_TW) from Paul (Thanks !)
		* Add it, nl, fr, pl, es, eu, ca translation updates (Thanks to
		  all translators)
		* Fix copyright for alc icons
		* Replace amule, wxCas, alc .ico simple icons by icons group .ico
		* Replace alcc's printf by wxLogMassage
		* Make runtime to be in seconds in amulesig.dat
		* Modify Xas to handle runtime in seconds
		* Modify wxCas to handle runtime in seconds

	Unleashed:
		* cas: some sprintf -> snprintf conversions, ifdef unix specific
		  code, and revert get_path() breakage

	Xaignar:
		* Other stuff I'm too lazy to write or have forgotten about. ;)
		* Initial multi-sorting on download list. Upon changing sort-column,
		  any items that were evaulated to equal will be resorted by the 
		  last used column.
		* Fixed the constant resetting of the category dropdown-menu in
		  the searchdlg.
		* Fixed "&"s being replaced with "&&" on the log-view.
		* Only displayed category color when the items arn't highlighted
		  on the download list, to improve readability. (thanks to Seagull)
		* Optimized the IPFilter-code.
		* Improved the CDownloadListCtrl::Updateitem function so that it 
		  doesn't search the list for hidden items.
		* Improved sorting of clients by QR on the download list.
		* Removed a number of unsued files, cutting down archive-size
		  by around 900kb.
		* Changed systray behavior to match KDE/GNOME. Single-clicks hide/show.
		* Fixed the "Last Recieved" column, which would show the 
		  same as the "Last Seen Completed" column.
		* Fixed the placement of sources on the download list, where they 
		  would sometimes be placed with the wrong file.
		* Cleanup of the new AICHSyncThread class.
		* Removed extra newlines before writing text to the logfile,
		  to avoid having a double-spaced file.
		* Fixed loading of addresses.dat, where the first line would
		  be ignored and replaced the messagebox with a log-line.
		* Fix the percentage displayed on the progress-bars being rounded,
		  which would result in non-completed files showing 100%.
		* Added the ability for the user to specify permission settings for 
		  fildes and directories. These settings default to 640 for files and
		  750 for directories and are used throughout the app, with the 
		  exception of files created with wxTextFile, as that class lacks 
		  support for permissions. Will be fixed later		  
		* Cleanup of CServerListCtrl:
		  - The sorting of the list is now always maintained, including when items 
		    on the list are updated or new items updated.
		  - Cleanup of the popup-menu.
		  - Disallow connecting to multiple servers at the same time.
		  - Other changes.
		* Reduced the overhead of the overhead calculation by using 
		  code that didn't require iterating through a list every time.
		* Added checks to avoid the user getting spammed with the "Connected
		  to user" and "Disconnected ..." when having an open chat-window.
		* Second reworking of the SearchDlg
		  - The crash on searching should be fixed now.
		  - Initial cleanups of the SearchList class
		* Cleanup of the SearchListCtrl class
		  - Results will now always be sorted
		  - Syncronized all lists during runtime, so that they behave 
		    as a single list.
		  - Improving the coloring of items.
		* Cleanup of the CMuleNotebook class
		* Cleanup of the CMuleListCtrl class:
		  - Added double-arrow for alternate sorting.
		  - Centralized a lot of logical plus lots of other changes
		* Double-buffered all listctrls using custom drawing, to reduce flicker.
		* Added warning if the user recieves LowID from the server.
		* Disallowing the user to send empty messages in the chat window.
		* Rewrote the PrefsUnifiedDlg class
		  - Removed the Rse classes and create a more clean replacement.
		  - Made the dialog mode-less.
		  - Removed the un-implemented Notify page
		  - Serveral other changes.
		* Updated the version reporting capabilities of aMule, so that it
		  will report version, wxWidgets type and version and if unicode
		  has been enabled or not.
		* Added the new MuleTextCtrl class which supports the traditional
		  popup-menu with Cut/Copy/Past/Clear and Select All. All existing
		  wxTextCtrls were replaced with this new class.
		* Imported the parts of Crypto++ that aMule needs into two files
		  with permission from the Crypto++ developer. This means that aMule 
		  now compiles without the user having Crypto++ installed, though it 
		  is still possible to use external Crypto++ installations if the user
		  wishes to do so.
		* Fixed some compilation problems with aLinkCreator and wx-2.5.2.
		* Fixed the First-Time-Message being displayed twice and rewrote it 
		  somewhat since it was becomming quite outdated.
		* Fixed the "unable to open preferences.dat" bugs.
		* Fixed the ability to add static servers.
		* Cleanup of column sorting functions.
		* Fixed a bug where CServer::HasDynIP would always return true.
		  This would result in need-less dns lookups.
		* Removed a redundant attempt at adding servers from connected 
		  clients.
		* Fix for Packet::PackPackets function where new size of packet 
		  wouldn't be saved.
		* Fixed some access to the dialog-window ptr after it had been
		  deleted. This was causing some odd behavior once in a while
		  on termination.
		* Fixed the downloadqueue sorting, which was reversed. Low-priorty 
		  files having high priority and high-priority files having low 
		  priority. (Thanks to thomas001 for noticing)
		* Rewroked the systray:
		  - Fixed the the problems with the rate-limiting functionality.
		  - Enabled use of PublicIP requests, so that the tray will show
		    the users actual IP rather than the interface IP.
		  - Some changes of the menu-structure.
		* Complete reworking of the hashing thread:
		  - More informative output
		  - Much better error handling
		  - Handles duplicate files gracefully
		  - Reads only 128kb (instead of 9mb) at a time to avoid killing 
		    the harddisk entirely while the thread is running.
		  - Made the thread terminate when no files are left, instead
		    of timing out as before.
		* Disconnected otherfunctions.h from the rest of the aMule code,
		  so that it should be possible to use it in external apps.
		* Added checks when using the client-pointer in the socket-code,
		  since that suffered from the same problem as the previously 
		  fixed clients (they have a habbit of dying at random).
		* Added function for truncanating displayed filenames, which is now
		  used in file-details dialog, to avoid it getting resized to 
		  extreme widths.
		* Some work on readying the Info tab on servers, deltaHF_ did the
		  rest of the work.
		* Small re-fix for the "mis-matching hash"-bug fix
		* Reworked the SearchDlg once
		  - Added Jugle.net websearch
		  - Added results-count to the result tabs
		  - Other smaller changes 
		* Fixed mem-leak where certian client-objects wouldn't be deleted. 
		  Specifically those that were removed from the download queue but 
		  wern't on the upload queue and didn't have a active socket.
		* Removed debugging functionality no longer needed.
		* Removed variable-arguments logging functions, since they were 
		  only needed in a very few places and posed a potential risk 
		  everywhere else.
		* Fixed StripInvalidFilenameChars function to avoid legit letters
		  being dropped (thanks to likesylph).
		* Changed all file-accessing to use CFile rather than a mix of CFile, 
		  wxFile and FILE.
		
		* Removed a number of warnings.
		* Cleanups of the following files
		  - AICHSyncThread.*
		  - ServerListCtrl.*
		  - SearchListCtrl.*
		  - MuleNotebook.*
		  - MuleListCtrl.*
		  - PrefsUnifiedDlg.*
		  - SysTray.*
		  - AddFileThread.*
		  - SearchDlg.*
		  - CMemFile.h and filemem.cpp
		  - SafeFiles.*
		  - CFile.*

		
	Special Thanks To:
		* Lucasvr, for providing fixes for compilation with some wx versions.
		* Seagull, for providing fixes and suggestions.
		* likesylph, for providing a fix for the StripInvalidFilenameChars function.
		* All translators
		* All testers
		* BrianHV and the people at #wxwidgets for their help and support
		* EVERYONE at #amule (even codewarrior2!)
		* All the people in aMule's forum
		* All the users, for having the patience to wait the delayed rc6 release.
		* Hellimod, one_2_one, ASTIOBOY, sssnake, lami123, Ocimin, agav,  PowerMike
		   and all the mac testers and people providing Macs for ssh & vnc. 

	Funny stuff about this changelog:
		* You can notice that the Search dialog was rewritten 3 (THREE!) times
		   between rc5 and rc6. You only get to see the final version (Xaignar's), 
		   but the initial one was Kry's (when the extended buttons show/hide 
		   were added) and then deltaHF changed it later. 
		   We just love changing that page.

Version 2.0.0rc5 - The 'Let's recover our release speed' version.
----------
2004-07-18

	deltaHF:
	        * Better sorting of some columns

	Kry:
		* Some gui design and coding of the upcoming Kad window
		* Protocol update:
			* UDP protocol upgraded to eMule 0.43b
			* TCP Standard Base protocol upgraded to eMule 0.43b
			* TCP Extended Base protocol upgraded to eMule 0.43b
		* Fixed memory corruption and crashes on 'cas'
		* Fixed gsocket-2.5.c for big endian archs.
		* Fixed CFile class to actually return error when a error ocurred and not only when it feels like.
		* Fixed bug where the 'All' category could be removed leading to crashes and other funny behaviours.
		* No more minimize when no tray has been selected.
		* Fixed browse skin file button to actually browse a file ;)
		* Fixed high 32 bits of transfered bytes not being loaded on known.met (sorry fluffly!)
		* Some Mac bugfixes.

	Hetfield:
		* Some gcc 3.4.x compilation fixes

	lfroen:
		* GUIEvents updated 
		* core2gui events added.
		* Some gcc 3.4 fixes to GUIEvents

	Phoenix:
		* Added a test with a warning to
		  CSearchDlg::OnBnClickedSdownload in SearchDlg.cpp. A NULL
		  value has been reported on the foruns, we don't know how
		  GetPage() or FindWindowById() could have returned NULL.
		* More unicode fixes to alcc and ed2khash.
		* Fixed flags for console applications. -DwxUSE_GUI=0 is
		  required so that amuleweb, amulecmd, etc, run fine with
		  wxWidgets version 2.5.2 and up.
		* Fixed a problem with gsocket-2.5.c when using wxWidgets
		  version 2.5.2 and up. Now amule runs with 2.5.2.
		* New ipfilter code.
		* Found the reason why wx-2.5.2 gui was messed: starting with
		  wx-2.5.2, a new flag must be added when adding components to
		  sizers to keep the old behaviour (wxFIXED_MINSIZE). This
		  constant is defined to zero in amule.h when wx-version is
		  less than 2.5.2, so that amule still compiles in old wx.
	
	ThePolish:
		 * Add win32 MakefileWIN32, configureWIN32.h and project file amule.msp
		 * Make win32 use winsock2 for IPFilter
		 * Enable alc, alcc, wxCas translations with aMule catalog
		 * Use normalized includes for wx in wxCas, alc and alcc
		 * Limit the server name length in wxCas to avoid a too large window
		 * New icon for alc
		 * Global fr translation
		 * Fix win32 ToolBar problem

	Xaignar:
		* Added the ability to search for "Texts"	
		* Attempt at fixing both Random Socket Bugs and Random Client Bugs.
		* Fixed new IPFilter code.
		* Cleanup of CPartFile::SavePartFile
		* Got rid of some unneeded includes.
		* Fixed compilation when using crypto++ 5.2
		* Ensuring that the ServerListCtrl gets unfrozen in case of corrupted met files.
		* Fixed a crash-bug added by Kry's UDP commit.

	Special thanks to:
		* The usual people, those on the other 'Thank you!' sections of changelog.
		* All the people at the Mac section of forums, for testing compilation and run.

		  NULL. This was the reason why aMule was crashing when trying
		  to connect to server with wxWidgets-2.5.2.

		  problem as amuleweb.
		* Commited a patch from wolti that fixes compilation on 
		  sparc/Solaris systems.
		* More sparc compilation fixes, thanks to wimms.
		* Removed the declaration of void ParseCommandLine(); from
		  TextClient.h and WebInterface.h. It seems to have been
		  forgotten here.
		* Patch to listctrl.cpp, was segfaulting in 2.5.1 when
		  hiding/resizing columns. In 2.4.2 was just asserting.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.0.0-rc2 - The 'white rabbit' version.
-------------
2004-04-11

	aquatroll:
	
		* Fixed Win32 compilation (again).

	Ariel:
	
		* Implemented completed parts count on file rehash.
		   Prevents your downloads to completely lost on a wrong .part.met write.
		   
	croakerc:
	        * Added zlib version check
		* *BSD compatibility
		
	deltaHF:
	
	        * New icon for aMule in DL/UP window ;)
		* curl-config now >= 7.9.5 (for debian)
		* i18n stuff
		* Removed double catalan entry from prefs
		* Fixed some typos

	hoschy, one-2-one, godard, PowerMike, hellimod:
	
	        * MacOSX stuff
		
	Jacobo221:
	
	        * Compiled the RC1 bugs and provided support on forums. It's our man-for-all.
		  	
	Kry:
	
		* Implemented the Complete count on search results and on file publishing.
		   This feature added since aMule 2.0.0-rc1 and eMule 0.42e was not released
		   with the rc1 for network technical reasons (still on testing with lugdunummaster).
		   When publishing a file, we also inform the server if the file is complete or not.
		   Search results show the count of complete sources sent by the server next to the sources
		   found: i.e. 100 (28) meaning 100 sources, 28 of them complete (72 incomplete or old client)
		* Added sending of the extended eMule version using aMule version, with additional rc version
		* Added parsing of the new 0.4x eMule tags on hello packets.		
		* Added parsing the Secure Ident packets for new eMule versions. Reduce overhead on download/upload.
		* Added HandShake check on upload request.
		* Rewrote display of client version on transfers page to handle the client soft/version correctly on any client.
		   That means eDonkeyHybrids and eMule does show now the correct version (i.e edonkey 0.50.1 or emule 0.42d)
		   aMule shows now as either "aMule 1.x (based on eMule v0.xx)" (<= 2.0.0-rc1) or aMule "A.B.C-rcX" (>= 2.0.0-rc2)
		* Fixed Mule Info packet only sent to eMule clients. Now is sent to old eMule && eMule-like clients (compatible clients)
		* Added 'Allocate Full Part File" and "Allocate Full Chunk" to preferences. None functional yet.
		* Fixed Client Detail Dialog to show correct client version.
		* Fixed comment mark on Download list being cut on the display.
		* Fixed the crashes on Base Client packets.
		* aMule now loads .par.met.BAK if the .part.met is 0-size (added to Ariel's commit, this prevents losing met files).
		* Made SafeMem files really safe checking for read after end of file.
		* Fixed wrong Modversion data (fixes random crash too)
		* Fixed assert on wrong upload list control data.
		* Fixed several crashes on wxString::GetData usage.
		* Fixed UDP disable button not being saved across sessions
		* Fixed a bug on new version check.
		* Locale goes to System Default on new version now (fixes weird language problems)
		* Fixed wrong OP_REASKFILEPING packets being sent .
		* Reverted GAddress_INET functions to standard inet_addr ones.
		* Completely removed list refresh functions. CPU saved was not worth it.
		* Added CheckDiskSpace checkbox and radio button to the preferences.
		* Added the scale of the connections graph on stats. (only rescaled on restart)
		* Added 'Reset' button for Server Log
		* Fixed: Right click popup on server connected was showing 'connect' now shows 'reconnect'.
		* gscocket shouldn't be compiled on Mac, and so it's not compiled now ;)
		* Fixed Preview of already completed files not working.
		* Fixed files > 2Gb not working on fast ed2k links handler and ed2k app.
		* Fixed file size for files larger then 2Gb displayed incorrectly
		* Changed timeout of curl functions to 10 - fixes hangups when clicking server update without
		   internet conenction.
		* We don't share 0 size files anymore.
		* Fixed the crash on invalid socket using 5 different ways. The last one seems to be the most stable.
		* Fixed several hangups on file completion.
		* Fixed % and progressbar not being updated when changed on GUI Tweaks.
		* Fixed comment packets. This was causing disconection from eMule clients (and crashing aMule clients)
		* Fixed amule dissapearing because sent to systray when --disable-systray was used.
		* Fixed memleak on search packet sent.
		* Fixed memleak on KnownFile deletion
		* Fixed memleak on search results received.
		* Fixed memleak on comment packet received.
		* Speeded up socket event handling.
		* Cleaned server connection. No more 'inet connection might be down' - unless it's down ;)
		* Faster PartFile processing.
		* Fixed endian issue on PartFile loading.
		* Fixed non-needed delete of an array on the notebook destructor.
		* Doesn't allow an incoming packet to get processed if socket is deleting.
		* Fixed double-highlight of servers if disconnected by the server.
		* Speeded up hashing of the files a lot. This should fix the gui hangs at startup.
		* Removed all old preferences code. That makes the app smaller, less memory used, and avoid some
		   unexpected bugs that arised on having 2 preferences implementation. Now New Prefs become Preferences.
		* Fixed SysTray and gtk-files being compiled even when disabled on configure.
		* Fixed several warnings.
		* Fixed assert on Clear All (search)
		* Make aMule compile on wxWidgets 2.5 (and CVS) version.
		
	Madcat:
	
	        * win32 LaunchUrl() function
		* Added amule-win32.HOWTO.txt
		* Better win32 version of Hostname() function

	shakraw:
	
		* WebSocket.* & WebServer.*: now uses wxThreads and
		  wxSockets to be cross platform.
		* Better threads' array remove in WebSocket
		* WebServer cleanly stopped before exit
		* Fixed multiple file download bug in webserver search section
		* Fixed ed2k download link
		* Fixed categories for web interface
		  
	thepolish:
	
	        * win32 stuff
		
	Unleashed:
	
	        * Memleak fix
		  
	Xaignar:
	
		* Amule no longer writes met files when priority is changed through the
		   auto-priority subsystem. Thus hd-writes are substancially reduced 
		   depending on the number of files set to auto-priority.
		* Fixed bug where text fields overlap each other (Disp. 4 & 5)
		* Cleanup of amuleDlg.*
		* aMule no longer displays a message about not being able to open the 
		   file "lastversion" the first time it is run
		* Changed the CTypedPtrList filelist in DownloadQueue.* to a std::deque,
		   with a speed-increase as a result
		* Fixed the bug where the background of previously selected items in the
		   friendslist wouldn't be redrawn (Disp. 2)
		* Fixed auto-priority. Priority would be set one tad too high, resulting
		   in the downloadlist failing to assign a name to the priority, thus 
		   leaving empty fields. Also fixed displaying of priorty "Auto [Lo]" 
		   in sharedfiles-list. (Tran. 3)
		* Fixed the problem where "completed percent" of files that hadn't 
		   transfered any bits yet would display a negative percentage (Disp. 8)
