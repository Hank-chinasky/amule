		* aMule:
			- Rewrote Makefile.am tree to fit to GNU standards
			- Removed Makefiles stuff for wxwidgets < 2.2.6

	Xaignar:
		* Merged lists used to identify file-types to avoid duplicity.

		* Fixed unsafe parsing of OP_SERVERIDENT type packets.

		* Fixed that we were always sending an OP_REASKACK packet and then the correct packet when recieving an OP_REASKFILEPING.
		* Fixed Bug 45: URLs are now properly escaped when opening browsers for Fake-check and such.
		* Fixed Bug 62: aMule will now be brought to front when left-clicking on the tray icon and when it is redisplayed after having been hidden.
		* Added checks against aggressive clients (clients who reask for files too often).
		* Imported checks for known leech-clients from the BlackRat eMule mod ( Many thanks to Le Rat Noir and inoteb for allowing us to use their work ).
		* Fixed wrong initialization of headers for some packets ( Thanks to thomas001 for reporting ).
		* Fixed a delete called on an uninitialized pointer in the statistics dialog and properly initalized serveral other pointers.
		* Optimizing the Comp(Up/Down)DatarateOverhead functions to something that didn't require traversing a list at each call.
		* Complete rework of the source-swapping functions.
		* Fixed the possibility of sources being added to multiple source-lists at the same time (No more mis-matching hashes warnings).
		* Fixed the new columns added by deltaHF not being displayed and added checks in case the same thing happens again.
		* Almost completly eleminated flicker on the download list and did a cleanup of the drawing routines associated the the download list widget.
		* Removed the following files:
		  - ini2.*
		  - CString.h
		  - mfc.h
		  - position.h
		  - resource.h
		  - strings.en
		* Cleaned up the following files:

Version 2.0.0-rc2 - The 'white rabbit' version.
-------------
2004-04-11

	aquatroll:
	
		* Fixed Win32 compilation (again).

	        * MacOSX stuff
		
	Jacobo221:
	
	        * Compiled the RC1 bugs and provided support on forums. It's our man-for-all.
		  	
	Kry:
	
		* Implemented the Complete count on search results and on file publishing.
		   This feature added since aMule 2.0.0-rc1 and eMule 0.42e was not released
		   with the rc1 for network technical reasons (still on testing with lugdunummaster).
		   When publishing a file, we also inform the server if the file is complete or not.
		   Search results show the count of complete sources sent by the server next to the sources
		   found: i.e. 100 (28) meaning 100 sources, 28 of them complete (72 incomplete or old client)
		* Added sending of the extended eMule version using aMule version, with additional rc version
		* Added parsing of the new 0.4x eMule tags on hello packets.		
		* Added parsing the Secure Ident packets for new eMule versions. Reduce overhead on download/upload.
		* Added HandShake check on upload request.
		* Rewrote display of client version on transfers page to handle the client soft/version correctly on any client.
		   That means eDonkeyHybrids and eMule does show now the correct version (i.e edonkey 0.50.1 or emule 0.42d)
		   aMule shows now as either "aMule 1.x (based on eMule v0.xx)" (<= 2.0.0-rc1) or aMule "A.B.C-rcX" (>= 2.0.0-rc2)
		* Fixed Mule Info packet only sent to eMule clients. Now is sent to old eMule && eMule-like clients (compatible clients)
		* Added 'Allocate Full Part File" and "Allocate Full Chunk" to preferences. None functional yet.
		* Fixed Client Detail Dialog to show correct client version.
		* Fixed comment mark on Download list being cut on the display.
		* Fixed the crashes on Base Client packets.
		* aMule now loads .par.met.BAK if the .part.met is 0-size (added to Ariel's commit, this prevents losing met files).
		* Made SafeMem files really safe checking for read after end of file.
		* Fixed wrong Modversion data (fixes random crash too)
		* Fixed assert on wrong upload list control data.
		* Fixed several crashes on wxString::GetData usage.

		* Locale goes to System Default on new version now (fixes weird language problems)
		* Fixed wrong OP_REASKFILEPING packets being sent .
		* Reverted GAddress_INET functions to standard inet_addr ones.
		* Completely removed list refresh functions. CPU saved was not worth it.
		* Added CheckDiskSpace checkbox and radio button to the preferences.
		* Added the scale of the connections graph on stats. (only rescaled on restart)
		* Added 'Reset' button for Server Log
		* Fixed: Right click popup on server connected was showing 'connect' now shows 'reconnect'.
		* gscocket shouldn't be compiled on Mac, and so it's not compiled now ;)
		* Fixed Preview of already completed files not working.
		* Fixed files > 2Gb not working on fast ed2k links handler and ed2k app.
		* Fixed file size for files larger then 2Gb displayed incorrectly
		* Changed timeout of curl functions to 10 - fixes hangups when clicking server update without
		   internet conenction.
		* We don't share 0 size files anymore.
		* Fixed the crash on invalid socket using 5 different ways. The last one seems to be the most stable.
		* Fixed several hangups on file completion.
		* Fixed % and progressbar not being updated when changed on GUI Tweaks.
		* Fixed comment packets. This was causing disconection from eMule clients (and crashing aMule clients)
		* Fixed amule dissapearing because sent to systray when --disable-systray was used.
		* Fixed memleak on search packet sent.
		* Fixed memleak on KnownFile deletion
		* Fixed memleak on search results received.
		* Fixed memleak on comment packet received.
		* Speeded up socket event handling.
		* Cleaned server connection. No more 'inet connection might be down' - unless it's down ;)
		* Faster PartFile processing.
		* Fixed endian issue on PartFile loading.
		* Fixed non-needed delete of an array on the notebook destructor.
		* Doesn't allow an incoming packet to get processed if socket is deleting.
		* Fixed double-highlight of servers if disconnected by the server.
		* Speeded up hashing of the files a lot. This should fix the gui hangs at startup.
		* Removed all old preferences code. That makes the app smaller, less memory used, and avoid some
		   unexpected bugs that arised on having 2 preferences implementation. Now New Prefs become Preferences.
		* Fixed SysTray and gtk-files being compiled even when disabled on configure.
		* Fixed several warnings.
		* Fixed assert on Clear All (search)
		* Make aMule compile on wxWidgets 2.5 (and CVS) version.
		
	Madcat:
	
	        * win32 LaunchUrl() function
		* Added amule-win32.HOWTO.txt
		* Better win32 version of Hostname() function

	shakraw:
	
		* WebSocket.* & WebServer.*: now uses wxThreads and
		  wxSockets to be cross platform.
		* Better threads' array remove in WebSocket
		* WebServer cleanly stopped before exit
		* Fixed multiple file download bug in webserver search section
		* Fixed ed2k download link
		* Fixed categories for web interface
		  
	thepolish:
	
	        * win32 stuff
		
	Unleashed:
	
	        * Memleak fix
		  
	Xaignar:
	
		* Amule no longer writes met files when priority is changed through the
		   auto-priority subsystem. Thus hd-writes are substancially reduced 
		   depending on the number of files set to auto-priority.
		* Fixed bug where text fields overlap each other (Disp. 4 & 5)
		* Cleanup of amuleDlg.*
		* aMule no longer displays a message about not being able to open the 
		   file "lastversion" the first time it is run
		* Changed the CTypedPtrList filelist in DownloadQueue.* to a std::deque,
		   with a speed-increase as a result
		* Fixed the bug where the background of previously selected items in the
		   friendslist wouldn't be redrawn (Disp. 2)
		* Fixed auto-priority. Priority would be set one tad too high, resulting
		   in the downloadlist failing to assign a name to the priority, thus 
		   leaving empty fields. Also fixed displaying of priorty "Auto [Lo]" 
		   in sharedfiles-list. (Tran. 3)
		* Fixed the problem where "completed percent" of files that hadn't 
		   transfered any bits yet would display a negative percentage (Disp. 8)
