 * This class takes care of transparently hashing files in seperate threads and
 * throws events once a file has been completed. By default it only uses a 
 * single thread, however, this can be changed by incrementing the MAXTHREADCOUNT
 * constant in AddFileThread.cpp. Each thread works by reading a chunk of the 
 * file (PARTSIZE bytes, see AddFileThread.cpp) and hashing that. Once there 
 * are no more files to hash, the threads die.
 *
 * You need to call Start() before the class will start spawning new threads, 
 * however, it does not matter if you call it before or after adding the files.
 * To terminate the threads, simply call Stop().
