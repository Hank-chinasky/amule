aMule online signature specification
------------------------------------

1. Introduction

The online signature does export statistics in a simple text oriented format.

It can be enabled within the Preferences dialogs of aMule.

Currently two formats of online signature are supported:
    * the original eMule online signature written to onlinesig.dat
    * the aMule online signature written to amulesig.dat

This document will detail on the later one.
