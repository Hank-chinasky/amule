Code Reorganization. BEFORE 2.0 FINAL!!!

I think that we should clean the amule cvs and sources management.
Considering that core and gui is pretty splitted i propose to:
a) move "project" directory into "src/gui" and use it to contain it!
b) move all GUI staff in gui directory
c) add "core" directory to "src"
d) add "EC" directory and move webserver and amulecmd apps there
e) add a "libs_patch" directory to manage all possibile/probably/future patch
to wx and similar libs

f) reduce the number of files! 89.cpp files and 105.h ones
are incredibily high for a p2p app! can be a kernel.
Let's merge some files and about all reduce 105-89=16 .h only files
these *should* be included only files, so can be merged in 1-2 max 3 files,
cause they're protected by #ifdef for duplicated inclusions.

of course all the file modification/moving should be managed in Makefile stuff.

g) Keep on using this TODO file cause it's readed by everyone, while forum a bit less 
 (me for example :PPP)
